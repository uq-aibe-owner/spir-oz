# SPIR-OZ
Adaptation of the Simple yet Powerful solution method and Inter-Regional model of Cai and Judd (2021), the python code of Scheidegger and Bilionis (2019) and the intermediate production elasticities and functional forms of Atalay (2017). We estimate and calibrate economic parameters for Australia, Queensland and regions within Queensland. 

We aim to answer questions relating to 2050 net-zero targets. For instance, what is the present value of a Qld net-zero target beyond that of Australia?

The result is a fully intertemporal model of the Australian economy that is smaller, yet deeper, than the Australian Treasury's Intersectoral Model (TIM). In contrast with TIM, our solution method is global; involves looking-ahead multiple-periods; moreover it accommodates uncertainty. That is, instead of log-linearising around the non-stochastic steady state, we generate a large number sample paths using the Certainty-Equivalent method of Cai and Judd to obtain the full solution. In contrast with Cai--Judd, our code is fully open-source (in python) and builds on Scheidegger and Bilionis (2019). Since we are interested in regional transition in Queensland across industries, we integrate the intersectoral framework of Atalay (2017).
