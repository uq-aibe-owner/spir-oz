It contains six folders in this package, for the examples in the following paper 
Cai, Y. and K.L. Judd (2021). A Simple but Powerful Simulated Certainty Equivalent 
Approximation Method for Dynamic Stochastic Problems. Working paper.

The folder "growth" is for solving the illustrative optimal growth model. 
The code file SCEQ_growth.m applies parallel SCEQ in Matlab to solve the model. 
The GAMS code file growth_SCEQ.gms solves the optimal growth model. It includes 
growth_SCEQ_common.gms which specifies the model setup. Here growth_SCEQ.gms 
requires an argument input, seedv, from the command line calling gams. This is 
to set a different seed for each compute core in parallelization. In 
growth_SCEQ_common.gms, the number of simulation paths is set to be 167 as there 
are six compute cores in the computer for running growth_SCEQ.gms in parallel. 
If you do not want to use parallelization, then you can simply comment out
option seed = %seedv%;
in growth_SCEQ.gms, and replace
set nsim /1*167/;
by
set nsim /1*1000/;
in growth_SCEQ_common.gms.
The GAMS code file growth_SCEQ_ErrorChecking.gms is for checking errors only. 
It includes growth_SCEQ_common.gms, and reads GaussHermiteData.txt that 
contains the Gauss-Hermite quadrature nodes and weights. It also reads  
the solutions generated by growth_SCEQ.gms which are stored in 
sim_paths_SCEQ_growth.gdx. 

The folder "RBC_Case1" is for solving multi-country RBC problems in Case 1. 
It uses the same code structure for the optimal growth model. 
In RBC_SCEQ_common.gms, the number of countries is set to be 10. You can 
change it to be another number, e.g., 200, by changing
set j countries /1*10/;
to
set j countries /1*200/;

The folder "RBC_Case2" is for solving multi-country RBC problems in Case 2. 
RBC_SCEQ.gms and RBC_SCEQ_common.gms are similar to Case 1. It does not 
need another code file for error checking, because it has already solved 
all possible simulation paths, and the Euler errors have been computed in 
RBC_SCEQ.gms on the pre-tipping path.

The folder "RBC_Case3" is for solving multi-country RBC problems in Case 3. 
The RBC_SCEQ.gms and RBC_SCEQ_common.gms are similar to Case 1. The reported 
Euler errors are computed in RBC_SCEQ.gms. 

The folder "NewKeynesian" is for solving the New Keynesian DSGE model with 
a zero lower bound. It uses the same code structure for the optimal growth model. 

Running the GAMS code files require a full version of GAMS. If you do not have it, you can 
submit the no-parallelization code files to the online NEOS server (using the GAMS version 
of CONOPT): https://neos-server.org/neos/ for a free run. If you want to run it on a local 
demo/student version of GAMS, then you could simply reduce the time horizon used for 
SCEQ (of course, it may reduce accuracy of solutions) and the number of countries for RBC 
models to meet the limit of the demo/student version. If you want to test it only,
you can reduce the number of simulation paths (and the number of periods of interest) 
to have a fast run.
