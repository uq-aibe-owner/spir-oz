    Unique element expected - symbol was not an element
       and the following text will be skipped until a proper
       symbol is found to recover. Remember that an UNQUOTED
       element has to start with a letter or digit
       followed by letters, digits, '+', '-' or '_'. The length
       is limited to 63 characters. The following words are
       reserved (starting symbols of a GAMS statement) and cannot
       be used for UNQUOTED set elements:
   
          ABORT, ACRONYM(S), ALIAS, BINARY, DISPLAY, ELSE
          EQUATION(S), EXECUTE, FILE(S), FOR, FREE, IF, INTEGER, LOOP
          MODEL(S), NEGATIVE, OPTION(S), PARAMETER(S)
          POSITIVE, PROCEDURE(S), PUT, PUTCLEAR, PUTCLOSE, PUTHD
          PUTPAGE, PUTTL, SCALAR(S), SEMICONT, SET(S), SOS1, SOS2
          TABLE, VARIABLE(S), WHILE
   
       QUOTED elements can contain any character. Single and
       double quotes can be used (starting and ending quote have
       to match).
